# Mantine layout components
Wrappers for Mantine v7 Stack and Group to make the naming more understandable. Just copy and paste these into your project. I use classnames package, but you can modify it to use anything.

You can install classnames by running `npm install classnames`

Mantine version: 7.0.0
